[{"content":"Now that our Check Point appliance is up, let\u0026rsquo;s get to work on setting it up for simple access for internal devices.\nDownload and install SmartConsole First thing, you have to download and install the Check Point SmartConsole, which is the thick client that allows you to manage your Check Point products. Remember that you need a Microsoft Windows operating system to use the SmartConsole.\nFrom the web interface go to \u0026ldquo;Maintenance\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Download SmartConsole\u0026rdquo;. Then click on the \u0026ldquo;Download Button\u0026rdquo;.\nOnce you have downloaded and successfully installed, launch the SmartConsole.\nEnter your username (\u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; if you used the default user) and the password you specified. Enter the Check Point management IP address then click \u0026ldquo;Login\u0026rdquo;.\nThe first time you\u0026rsquo;re logging in you will get a \u0026ldquo;Fingerprint\u0026rdquo; prompt to confirm that you\u0026rsquo;re connecting to the correct server, and not some rouge one somewhere.\nYou can confirm the fingerprint by going to the web interface of the management server and doing a search for \u0026ldquo;fingerprint\u0026rdquo;, or go to \u0026ldquo;System Management\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Certificate Authority\u0026rdquo;.\nCompare the fingerprint on the page, to the fingerprint in the SmartConsole. Then click proceed if it matches. Otherwise, you have some investigating to do.\nGetting familiar with SmartConsole Now that SmartConsole is installed and connected to the firewall, let\u0026rsquo;s check out some basic features that you\u0026rsquo;ll use regularly.\nIn the first pane you have an overview of all the gateways and servers in your Check Point estate. In this case I have only one, but if you have several enforcement points, logging servers and a management server, you will find them all here.\nAt the right you\u0026rsquo;ll see all the objects that are available to view and configure. You\u0026rsquo;ll see some later down, but I\u0026rsquo;ll go more into these in a later post.\nIn the \u0026ldquo;Security Policies\u0026rdquo; section you configure the security features such as rules, network address translation (NAT) and inspection policies.\nSelecting \u0026ldquo;Policy\u0026rdquo; under \u0026ldquo;Access Control\u0026rdquo; shows you the rule base. For a clean install, only one rule is present, which is the \u0026ldquo;Cleanup Rule\u0026rdquo;. This is an explicit \u0026ldquo;deny all\u0026rdquo; rule. While many firewalls allow all traffic - or web only traffic - by default, Check Point will have none of that. You need to explicitly allow your traffic.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;NAT\u0026rdquo; to view the network address translation rules. There are only a couple automatic rules right now. We\u0026rsquo;ll go through NAT and configuring NAT rules at another time.\nGo to the \u0026ldquo;Logs and Monitor\u0026rdquo; section to access the log viewer. Check Point has, in my opinion, the best log viewer of any firewall that I\u0026rsquo;ve used. The log viewer has remained largely unchanged over the past twenty years and has always remained highly usable. This is an area we\u0026rsquo;ll explore another time as well.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Manage \u0026amp; Settings\u0026rdquo; section allows you to configure the administrative management settings.\nGo to \u0026ldquo;Permissions and Administrators\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Administrators\u0026rdquo;. Here you can add/delete/modify administrators for the Check Point management console. This is for Check Point management and not for the web interface, which is done via the Gaia web management.\nGo to \u0026ldquo;Trusted Clients\u0026rdquo; and you can limit the clients that can connect to the Check Point management by adding them here and removing \u0026ldquo;AnyHost\u0026rdquo;.\nGo to \u0026ldquo;Sessions\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;View Sessions\u0026rdquo; and you can see the sessions that are connected to the management console at the moment. It\u0026rsquo;s only my connection here, but Check Point has added the capability for multiple persons to edit the rulebase at a time; this was previously not possible and was a pleasant surprise for me when I first upgraded to R80.\nYou can see the revisions made on the rulebase by going to \u0026ldquo;Revisions\u0026rdquo;. This is useful as your rulebase becomes more complicated and you have multiple administrators.\nEnough of an overview, let\u0026rsquo;s get to configuring some rules.\nAdding the networks to the gateway object Before we start with the rules, we need to ensure that the gateway has access to all of the network interfaces available to it.\nRemember that the Check Point security gateway is an application on top of the operating system, which is Gaia (a hardened version of Linux). This is different to other firewalls such as Cisco ASA or Fortinet Fortigates where the OS and the firewall are one. So while the interfaces may have been configured in Gaia, we need to add them to the Check Point gateway.\nOpen the Check Point gateway object by double-clicking on it, or by selecting and clicking on the pencil icon above the list.\nThe \u0026ldquo;General Properties\u0026rdquo; shows an overview of the gateway and shows the features enabled for it. You can check other features to enable, but we won\u0026rsquo;t get into that right now.\nGo to \u0026ldquo;Network Management\u0026rdquo;. Here you will see a list of the interfaces currently available. You will notice that the DMZ interface that we configured is not showing in the list. Also the \u0026ldquo;Topology\u0026rdquo; is shown as \u0026ldquo;Undefined\u0026rdquo;. Topology is how Check Point determines which networks are behind which interfaces so that it can do reverse-path and anti-spoofing checks.\nTo add the other interfaces click on \u0026ldquo;Get Interfaces\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Get interfaces with Topology\u0026rdquo;. This will get all the interfaces and any routing information as well.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll get a little warning about getting the interfaces with topology. This is safe to do given that this is a new firewall; however, if you have an existing firewall and you\u0026rsquo;ve configured custom topologies and anti-spoofing settings, then it is best to not get the interfaces with topology and configure the topology manually.\nIn this case, we shout \u0026ldquo;YOLO\u0026rdquo; and click \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;.\nYou get the results of the retrieval. Notice that the DMZ interface was retrieved as eth2, while the others are unchanged.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Accept\u0026rdquo;.\nNow our networks have been defined, along with the topology. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that eth0 was defined as \u0026ldquo;External\u0026rdquo; in the topology; this is because the default gateway was specified for that network.\nImplied rules Now that the networks have been defined let\u0026rsquo;s look at creating access control policies, or rules.\nBefore we do that, there are some implied rules that exist. These are rules that are not explicitly defined in the rulebase, but exist in the firewall configuration. These are to allow access mainly for management and control protocols.\nYou can view these implied rules by clicking on the three-dots, or ellipses, or kebab, above the rules and going to \u0026ldquo;Actions\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Implied Rules\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.\nHere you can view the implied rules configured.\nIf you wish to change these implied rules, you go to the \u0026ldquo;Global Properties\u0026rdquo; in the main menu bar dropdown.\nHere you can select which ones you wish to allow or deny, and where they can exist in the rulebase if available. I\u0026rsquo;ve only ever done this once for a customer, but for every other implementation I\u0026rsquo;ve kept the defaults. If you do decide to uncheck certain items, you need to explicitly configure the rules in the rulebase or you can lock yourself out.\nNotice that implied rules are not logged by default.\nCreate your first rules Let\u0026rsquo;s create a rule. We\u0026rsquo;ll create a rule to allow internal users to access all the services over the \u0026ldquo;Internet\u0026rdquo;.\nRight-click on a rule in the rulebase and select either \u0026ldquo;Above\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Below\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;New Rule\u0026rdquo;. Rules are evaluated from top-to-bottom order, so you need to place the rule above the \u0026ldquo;Cleanup rule\u0026rdquo;.\nAstute readers would notice another rule defined that was not there before called the \u0026ldquo;Stealth Rule\u0026rdquo;. I put that rule in but didn\u0026rsquo;t capture it; sorry if that confused you. The stealth rule \u0026ldquo;hides\u0026rdquo; the firewall from anyone trying to connect directly to it, and is a best practice.\nSpecify the source by clicking on the plus sign, or add button, in the cell. A dialog showing all of the available network objects is displayed. Because the Internal network is not yet created, click on the star icon at the top, right-hand corner of the dialog box to add it.\nSpecify the name of the object, the IP address and network mask.\nOptionally, you can change the colour of the object and add a tag, which is assist in administration, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t change functionality.\nBy default, Check Point does not enable NAT. Click on \u0026ldquo;NAT\u0026rdquo; and check the box \u0026ldquo;Add automatic address translation rules\u0026rdquo;.\nEnsure that the \u0026ldquo;Translation method\u0026rdquo; is selected as \u0026ldquo;Hide\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Hide behind the gateway\u0026rdquo; is selected. This means that all traffic coming from that network is \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo; behind the destination interface of the firewall, in this case eth0\u0026rsquo;s IP address. You can choose to hide behind another IP address in cases where you have others to use.\nThe other option of \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo; is for 1-to-1 NAT, and is not generally utilised for network objects.\nClick \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; to save.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll set this rule to \u0026ldquo;any\u0026rdquo; destination. Click on the down arrow and select \u0026ldquo;Switch to \u0026lsquo;Any\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;.\nRepeat this for \u0026ldquo;Services \u0026amp; Applications\u0026rdquo; for now. This is the destination service.\nRules are created as \u0026ldquo;Drop\u0026rdquo; by default. Click the down arrow and select \u0026ldquo;Accept\u0026rdquo; to allow the traffic.\nRules by default are not logged. Click on the down arrow and select \u0026ldquo;Log\u0026rdquo; to log the traffic.\nThe other option is \u0026ldquo;Alert\u0026rdquo; and allows for alerts to be sent, e.g. via email, when a rule is hit. This is useful for cases such as honeypots, so you can be alerted to possible malicious activities taking place.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a rule to allow ICMP traffic (pings, traceroute, etc.) from both the Internal network and the DMZ to anywhere, including the firewall. This is just like the previous rule, but because we wish to be able to ping the firewall, we need to create it above the stealth rule.\nYou will also need to create a network object for the DMZ network, which you should be able to using the Internal_Net example.\nBut because we only want to allow ICMP, we need to specify the service. Click the plus, or add, button in the cell under \u0026ldquo;Services \u0026amp; Applications\u0026rdquo;. Search for \u0026ldquo;icmp\u0026rdquo;, then select \u0026ldquo;icmp-request\u0026rdquo; by clicking on the plus, or add, sign. Close the dialog box.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the rule for user internet access to allow just HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Go to the rule, and click on the plus, or add, sign in the cell under \u0026ldquo;Services \u0026amp; Applications\u0026rdquo; and search for \u0026ldquo;http\u0026rdquo;. Then select \u0026ldquo;http\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;https\u0026rdquo; by clicking on the plus, or add, sign. Close the dialog.\nNow we have our initial rulebase to be installed.\nIf you look at the top, you\u0026rsquo;ll see some menu items. That number - 35 in this case - is the number of changes to be made. If you go through the previous screenshots, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the number changing with each change.\nAt this point we can discard all of the changes, or we can publish them. Publishing saves the changes, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t push, or install, the policy on the firewall. This allows changes to be made during the day, and then pushed out during a maintenance window if anything.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;Publish\u0026rdquo; to publish your changes. You can change the name and add a description, which is highly recommended as it gives other administrators, and even you, an idea of what change was made and why. In my practice, I also add the ticket number assigned for the change to reference.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve published the changes, you can go ahead and click on \u0026ldquo;Install Policy\u0026rdquo;, which will push the policy to the firewalls.\nNote, you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to publish first, and then install the policy. If you click on \u0026ldquo;Install Policy\u0026rdquo; without publishing, you will be asked to publish the changes before the installation will continue.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Install Policy\u0026rdquo; dialog is pretty standard in our case as there is only one firewall, but you can have multiple gateways to push to, including clusters.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Install\u0026rdquo;.\nA progress indication is show at the bottom, left-hand corner. You can click on the bar to see more info.\nInstall successful. If you see any red X\u0026rsquo;s, you need to investigate. But for our simple setup here, this shouldn\u0026rsquo;t happen.\nAnd there you go, you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first rule. You can go ahead and test access. If you\u0026rsquo;re not getting through then you can check the logs for some help. My next Check Point post will go into more on the log viewer and on configuring NAT, once I get to it before this eval expires on me.\n","permalink":"https://essgeelabs.com/posts/configure-your-check-point-firewall/","summary":"In this second instalment of getting a Check Point home lab built, it\u0026rsquo;s time to create some rules to get started.","title":"Configure Your Check Point Firewall"},{"content":"I mentioned before that I installed Proxmox so that I could train up my team. One of the technology products that I have to train on is Check Point firewalls. If you are also interested in building your own Check Point lab, whether for training or to get familiar with it, I hope this helps.\nBut first\u0026hellip;\nA little about Check Point Check Point has been around as a company since 1993, and started in Israel. Check Point is the company that created the first stateful inspection firewall - Firewall-1 - and vastly improved the security of firewall products, which at the time were either proxies, or packet filters.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been administering and supporting Check Point products since 2001, and consider it to be the most mature of firewall products. Check Point focuses on security, which is why many consider them to be best-of-breed, even with all the competition that they have been facing recently, especially from Fortinet.\nAnyway, enough of that.\nGetting Started As a lab, performance is not going to be end-goal here, so we\u0026rsquo;ll settle for the minimum requirements. A quick web search of \u0026ldquo;Check point Open Server minimum requirements\u0026rdquo; would yield a Check Point page showing that at minimum we\u0026rsquo;d need:\n4 CPU cores 8 GB RAM 110 GB Hard Drive Space And network interfaces of course. You will also require a Microsoft Windows client to allow you to manage the firewall.\nThe easiest way to find the Check Point ISO image download is to do a web search, because finding it on Check Point\u0026rsquo;s site is hopeless.\nThe version available at the time of writing is R81.10. Much of the guidance here will still hold for earlier versions, and hopefully for future versions. As always, check your release notes.\nYou will need to login or sign-up for a UserCenter account to download, which is free and simple. Download and save.\nCreating the virtual machine Once you\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded the ISO image to the virtual host (Proxmox in my case), let\u0026rsquo;s create a virtual machine.\nNote: I\u0026rsquo;m using a different Proxmox install, so some of the storage locations and virtual networks are different from my previous posts.\nGive the VM a name.\nUse the Check Point ISO image that was downloaded and uploaded to the virtual host.\nUse the default settings for the system.\nFor the disk, set the device as \u0026ldquo;SATA\u0026rdquo;. The Check Point install does not have drivers for the SCSI drives. It can be installed, but is unnecessary for this lab, but feel free to try and let me know.\nThe minimum disk size should be 110GB based on the minimum requirements; I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen 265GB.\nThe minimum number of cores is 4, so we\u0026rsquo;ll go with that.\nThe minimum amount of RAM is 8GB, so we\u0026rsquo;ll use that as well.\nSpecify your network interface. The wizard only allows one, but we\u0026rsquo;ll add more later. I\u0026rsquo;m using a bridged interface to my local network so that I can access the firewall from my machine.\nBut if you want to have your lab totally isolated, you can choose a different interface. Remember that you need a Microsoft Windows client to manage the firewall, so that will need to access the network you specify.\nWhen you start the VM the installation will start. You will need to access the console to perform the installation.\nSelect your keyboard language.\nBecause we are using a small hard disk, keep the recommended size (Default).\nSet the \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; account password. This password is how you will login to the Gaia page, or command-line.\nSet the management interface IP. This is dependent upon the virtual interface that you\u0026rsquo;ve specified.\nFinally, click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; to start the installation process.\nWhen installation is complete, you will be asked to reboot. Note the message to connect to the web interface to complete the configuration.\nWhen the system reboots the console will show a login screen for the command-line interface. You can login here using the user as \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; and the password you specified during install.\nAt this point though, shut down the VM so that we can add more interfaces. Remember that we\u0026rsquo;ve only added one so far, and as a firewall we\u0026rsquo;d want at least two - Internal and External.\nYou can login to the console and type halt or you can use the \u0026ldquo;Shutdown\u0026rdquo; button in Proxmox to shut down.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve added two more interfaces - one internal and one DMZ. These are virtual interfaces to the VM host, but you choose what you want to do.\nFirst time configuration Once you\u0026rsquo;ve added the interfaces, start back the machine and now login using the URL as https://\u0026lt;management IP address\u0026gt;. Click continue at the \u0026ldquo;Privacy Error\u0026rdquo; page, which is due to a self-signed certificate being used.\nAt the login screen, use \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; as the username, and the password that you created at the installation.\nYou will be greeted with the \u0026ldquo;Check Point First Time Configuration Wizard\u0026rdquo;. Click \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; to continue.\nChoose \u0026ldquo;Continue with R81.10 configuration\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you want to change your management interface IP you can do so.\nWhen setting up standalone deployments (both security gateway and management in one) the standard recommendation was to use the public IP as the management IP, which becomes the object IP in Check Point (more about that in later posts).\nHowever, I usually recommend to use the Internal IP address. Further, when you have tiered deployments (separate management and security gateways) the management IP is usually internal anyway.\nSetup your next interface. The wizard only sets up two interfaces, so we\u0026rsquo;ll set up the other one later. Pay no mind about the \u0026ldquo;connect to Internet\u0026rdquo; description. I\u0026rsquo;m setting this interface up as my Internal interface.\nSpecify the hostname and the DNS servers to use.\nSpecify the date and time, or use NTP. NTP is always recommended for production, but you can go manual in the lab.\nSelect the installation type as \u0026ldquo;Security Gateway and/or Security Management\u0026rdquo;, as we\u0026rsquo;ll be using a standalone install.\nCheck both \u0026ldquo;Security Gateway\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Security Management\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can create an administrative user for the Check Point management. Note that this is not for the web interface (Gaia), but for SmartConsole to manage the Check Point firewall itself.\nSpecify clients that can manage the Check Point firewall. As this is a lab we\u0026rsquo;re allowing everyone.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Finish\u0026rdquo; to complete the wizard.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; to confirm.\nAfter the configuration is completed the \u0026ldquo;Overview\u0026rdquo; page is displayed. At the left there are the sections to administer the appliance settings, which is the operating system settings.\nConfigure additional networks We\u0026rsquo;ve configured only two network interfaces thus far - Internal and External. To configure the DMZ interface, go to \u0026ldquo;Network Management\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Network Interfaces\u0026rdquo;.\nSelect the interface to edit, and click on \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo;.\nConfigure the settings and then check the \u0026ldquo;Enable\u0026rdquo; box to activate the interface.\nThe interface should now be shown as \u0026ldquo;Up\u0026rdquo; once it is connected to a virtual network, otherwise it would be shown as red and \u0026ldquo;Down\u0026rdquo; (as compared to grey and \u0026ldquo;Down\u0026rdquo;, which indicates disabled interfaces).\nWith all this setup, you are now ready to connect using the SmartConsole and start configuring the firewall itself, which we will go into in a next post.\nCheck license status Now all this is with a trial of Check Point, which allows you to use the features for 15 days after which you need to license it. You can check your evaluation status by going to \u0026ldquo;Maintenance\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;License Status\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"https://essgeelabs.com/posts/build-a-check-point-firewall-lab/","summary":"Check Point is the most mature firewall in the industry. Here we install the firewall and management in a lab environment that you can use for testing or training.","title":"Build a Check Point Firewall Lab"},{"content":"Now that Proxmox is running and the virtual networks are setup, let\u0026rsquo;s now spin up some virtual instances. We\u0026rsquo;ll look at create standard Virtual Machines and then Linux Containers.\nCreating a Virtual Machine At the top right-hand corner, select \u0026ldquo;Create VM\u0026rdquo;.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Create: Virtual Machine\u0026rdquo; wizard will show up. Give your VM a name.\nNext, select an ISO image to boot from, or you can use physical media if you\u0026rsquo;re really old school.\nI\u0026rsquo;m using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\nI generally keep the system settings default, but you can change these settings depending on the OS you\u0026rsquo;re using, like if they\u0026rsquo;re older.\nSet your Disks next. Specify the storage location, which is usually either an LVM or LVM-Thin location. Set your Disk size as well depending on the minimum requirements of the OS.\nChoose your CPU settings depending on the minimum requirements of the OS. A socket is a processor, and the cores define the number of cores per processor. This is virtualised, but sockets x cores count must not exceed the total number of sockets x cores you have on your physical machine.\nSpecify the amount of memory required for the OS. The total amount of memory per system should not exceed the amount of physical memory available on the node, less the memory required to run Proxmox itself.\nSpecify the network to be used. Here I\u0026rsquo;m using the vmbr10 interface.\nConfirm your settings. You can choose to start the VM now by checking the \u0026ldquo;Start after created\u0026rdquo; box, but we\u0026rsquo;ll just click \u0026ldquo;Finish\u0026rdquo; for now.\nOnce the VM is created, you can select it on the left-hand pane, and then click \u0026ldquo;Start\u0026rdquo; at the top right-hand corner.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;Console\u0026rdquo; in the settings pane to view the machine display. You now have a working VM. Once it\u0026rsquo;s fully booted, you can log in and configure the settings.\nCreating a Linux Container I briefly discussed containers in the overview of Proxmox. Here we will create one. Remember that containers will only be Linux-based.\nAt the top right-hand side, click on \u0026ldquo;Create CT\u0026rdquo;.\nA wizard similar to the VM creation wizard will appear. The dialogue is similar, but you will notice some differences.\nIn the \u0026ldquo;General\u0026rdquo; settings specify the \u0026ldquo;Hostname\u0026rdquo;, which will be set at the hostname of your VM. Also specify the password, which will be the password of the root account. You can also add an SSH public key that will allow you to access the machine using key-based authentication, but we\u0026rsquo;ll just set the password for now.\nNext choose a container template. I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the WordPress one.\nSpecify the disk size and storage location. Remember that containers are lightweight and don\u0026rsquo;t need as much storage as a full VM, since it shares the kernel with the host. So the storage is mainly for the user files on the system.\nSpecify the number of cores. Notice that there is no socket option here as we\u0026rsquo;re specifying how many cores we\u0026rsquo;re going to make available to the container.\nNext specify the memory required. Again, for a container, we can use a small memory size.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the network section allows many settings to be entered. Specify the virtual network for the container, also specify the IP address and prefix length.\nThen specify the DNS settings. I\u0026rsquo;m using Google\u0026rsquo;s DNS.\nReview your settings and click \u0026ldquo;Finish\u0026rdquo;.\nSelect the new container you created in the left-hand pane, and then click \u0026ldquo;Start\u0026rdquo; at the top right-hand corner.\nLike VMs, you can access the console by going to \u0026ldquo;Console\u0026rdquo; in the VM settings pane.\nViewing and Changing settings of a VM Once you\u0026rsquo;ve created a VM, you can always see a summary and the settings by using the Settings pane for the machine. Here we can see a summary of the Windows Server host that I created.\nTo change any hardware setting, such as changing the network that it\u0026rsquo;s connected to, go to the \u0026ldquo;Hardware\u0026rdquo; setting and edit the \u0026ldquo;Network Device\u0026rdquo;. Some settings such as the Network Device can be changed while the VM is running, others such as memory and processors need the system to be turned off or rebooted.\nConnecting a VM to a VLAN on a Trunk port Remember in the last post that we created vmbr1 as a trunk port. If I wanted to add my VM to connect to VLAN 101 on that port, I would select the \u0026ldquo;Bridge\u0026rdquo; as vmbr1 and the \u0026ldquo;VLAN Tag\u0026rdquo; as 101. Now that machine can communicate with the physical network once I add an IP in that network range.\nConclusion You now know enough to configure your own Proxmox system and start your virtual instances. Build your lab and remember to have fun.\nLet me know of your experiences.\n","permalink":"https://essgeelabs.com/posts/virtual-machines-in-proxmox/","summary":"Now that Proxmox and the virtual networks are setup, we can spin up some virtual instances.","title":"Virtual Machines in Proxmox"},{"content":"In my last post I gave a brief overview of Proxmox. You can go ahead and start launching VMs now if you wish, but if you\u0026rsquo;re building a LAB then you want to have machines talk to each other separately from your main network. This is best if you plan to do some security stuff and may have malware or vulnerable machines in there.\nTo do this you\u0026rsquo;ll need to create virtual networks. Virtual networks are not connected to the main network and allow all the machines connected to a virtual network to communicate with each other. You can also communicate with the host server if you wish by providing an IP address. In my case I didn\u0026rsquo;t do this as I used a virtual firewall to provide connectivity to each network.\nGetting started To get started, first go to the network settings on the Proxmox node.\nMy node has two onboard network adaptors seen in the below as eno1 and eno2. If you have only one you will only see one.\nProxmox create bridged interfaces for its virtual networking. vmbr0 is the one automatically created at setup when you were asked to provide an IP address for the node. If you edit that interface you will see that it\u0026rsquo;s tied to eno1 and you can change it here if you wish, including the IP address of the node.\nTrunk Ports I tend to leave the vmbr0 interface separate for management and then configure the next physical interface to connect the virtual instances if they need to access the physical network. This is the vmbr1 interface as shown below. I\u0026rsquo;ve also configured this as a trunk port by checking the \u0026ldquo;VLAN aware\u0026rdquo; box. This means that it will send and recognised 802.1q VLAN tags. You will need to connect that port to a switch port configured as an 802.1q trunk.\nCreating virtual networks for your VMs To create virtual networks separate from the physical network you create bridges. To start click \u0026ldquo;Create\u0026rdquo; then select \u0026ldquo;Linux Bridge\u0026rdquo;.\nGive the bridge a name. I chose vmbr10 to represent the 192.168.10.0/24 network, and vmbr100 to represent the 192.168.100.0/24 network. But you can decide your own convention.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to provide an IP address here. This is only if you want to give the node an IP address on that network. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want your VMs to communicate with the node itself, then don\u0026rsquo;t enter an IP address here.\nOnce set you can now proceed to create VMs and assign to the network. We\u0026rsquo;ll go through than in the next tutorial.\nVLAN interfaces If you want your host node to communicate with other VLANs in the physical network, you can create VLAN interfaces. There are few cases you may want to do this, but I\u0026rsquo;ll still show you the process. These interfaces cannot be assigned to virtual machines, and it\u0026rsquo;s only to communicate with the node.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Create\u0026rdquo; and then \u0026ldquo;Linux VLAN\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the dialog box you will enter the name as an existing interface with the sub-interface (VLAN) ID, or use the name as VLANxxx, where xxx is the VLAN ID and set the VLAN raw device as the existing interface.\nFor example, using vmbr1, which is VLAN aware, we set the name as vmbr1.101, which sets the existing interface to vmbr1 and the VLAN as 101.\nNAT interfaces One of the features that I liked about VMWare workstation is that it comes with a NAT interface. It\u0026rsquo;s where I can assign the VM to that network and it would access the physical network using the IP address of the host. It will hide behind the host\u0026rsquo;s IP address to access external resources.\nThe same can be done with Proxmox, but not via the Web GUI. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to do some shell editing for this.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;Shell\u0026rdquo; and a shell interface will pop out.\nAt the command-line type:\nnano /etc/network/interfaces\nScroll to the bottom and add the following:\nauto vmbr999\riface vmbr999 inet static\raddress 192.168.254.1/24\rbridge-ports none\rbridge-stp off\rbridge-fd 0\rpost-up echo 1 \u0026amp;gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward\rpost-up iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s \u0026#39;192.168.254.0/24\u0026#39; -o vmbr0 -j MASQUERADE\rpost-down iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s \u0026#39;192.168.254.0/24\u0026#39; -o vmbr0 -j MASQUERADE\r#NAT Bridge vmbr999 is the name I chose, but you can choose differently.\nThe IP address \u0026ldquo;192.168.254.1/24\u0026rdquo; is going the be the IP address of the node, and this will be set as the default gateway of the VMs that you assign to the network.\nThe first post-up enables IP forwarding allows the node to route traffic between interfaces. The second post-up enables the NAT. These are run when the interface comes up. The post-down is run when the interface is brought down and deletes the NAT.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve entered the settings, enter control-o to save, then control-x to exit.\nNow type:\nservice networking restart\nThis restarts the networking service and will temporarily disrupt network connectivity to the node and VMs.\nThe interface will be visible in the Web GUI, but you can\u0026rsquo;t change the settings that were entered in the config file.\nNext steps Now that virtual networks have been created, we\u0026rsquo;ll move on next to creating our virtual machines.\n","permalink":"https://essgeelabs.com/posts/virtual-networking-within-proxmox/","summary":"In the last post I gave a brief overview of Proxmox, now we discuss creating virtual networks to allow VMs to communicate.","title":"Virtual Networking Within Proxmox"},{"content":"I have some new team members and need them to get up to speed with a few things. One of the best ways to get comfortable with technologies is to actually get some practical experience with it. So we needed to get a lab up and running.\nIn the past I built my labs using either VMWare Workstation on EXSi. However, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a license for Workstation, and I\u0026rsquo;m using some old, decommissioned server hardware for the lab, so I decided to try Proxmox.\nWhat is Proxmox? Proxmox is an open-source virtualisation platform based on KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) and (LXC) Linux containers, and built on Debian Linux.\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t let its open-source nature fool you, this platform is chock-full of enterprise features such as:\nWeb-based management interface High-availability (HA) clustering capabilities Software-defined storage Virtual networking REST API And security features such as: Role-based access controls 2FA Firewall And even though my hardware was old, it was able to run the latest version of Proxmox, as compared to ESXi, where I would be stuck at version 6.5.\nRequired hardware for Proxmox From the System Requirements page, Proxmox requires at minimum:\n64bit (Intel EMT64 or AMD64) CPU Intel VT/AMD-V capable CPU/Mainboard for KVM full virtualization support 1 GB RAM, plus additional RAM needed for guests Hard drive capacity to support the OS, installation images, and virtual machine drives. Proxmox doesn\u0026rsquo;t recommend anything, but I suggest nothing less than 256GB. One network port (NIC), but I suggest two if you can - one for management, and the other for VM connectivity. I used an old Dell T310 server with 24GB of RAM, and 3 x 600GB hard-disks in a single RAID 0 array for 1.8TB of capacity (it\u0026rsquo;s a lab so I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for redundancy).\nDownloading and installing Proxmox To get started you will need a 2GB USB stick if you\u0026rsquo;re using version 7.x. You could use a 1GB stick if you\u0026rsquo;re using version 6.4, but you\u0026rsquo;ll get more stability with version 7.\nDownload the Proxmox ISO image from the official site.\nOnce you have the image downloaded you\u0026rsquo;ll create the bootable USB drive. You can find the installation instructions here. I use MS Windows so I used Rufus to create my bootable drive.\nI installed my setup using the default settings and standard LVM (Logical Volume Manager). You will need to have the server connected to the network so that you can access the web management interface. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be connected to the Internet, but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended so that you can get updates.\nGetting familiar with the web management interface Once the server is up and running you will get a screen telling you to connect to the web management interface on port 8006 via the URL:\nhttps://\u0026lt;ip address of host\u0026gt;:8006\nAnd log on with the root account and password that you created during the installation process.\nNote: The screenshots in the examples are of my setup so you will see some machines have already been created. You will obviously not have any machines as yet.\nThe main interface This is the main dashboard where you can see an overall view of the status of the platform and access all the management components. I\u0026rsquo;ve highlighted the main areas for you to access.\nNode view If you click on a node (individual server) you\u0026rsquo;ll see the dashboard change to show status information about the node. You will also be able to access settings specific to the node in the settings pane.\nHere you can see overall stats about the CPU, memory and Hard Disk usage. Note that the HD usage is the system disk and not the space available for virtual machines.\nNetwork view You can view all the network interfaces and all the virtual networks in this setting under the node. We\u0026rsquo;ll discuss setting up virtual networks next time. For now, know that here you can specify the networks that virtual machines can either communicate with each other, or to the physical network.\nDisk view You can view disks and partitions on the node in the disk view. You can perform some operations on the disks here as well. We\u0026rsquo;ll probably explore some things here in later posts.\nStorage, images and templates Selecting the storage components you can see the details about each storage element. Proxmox supports different types of storage and you can read more about it on their wiki. When you install Proxmox on your server you should get two types - Directory and LVM-Thin.\nDirectory storage The directory storage type is a local directory that will store things like ISO images and container templates.\nISO Images You can upload ISO images onto your node by selecting \u0026ldquo;ISO Images\u0026rdquo; in the settings pane. Here you can either upload ISO images to the node, or have it download it directly from a URL if it can access it.\nContainer Templates Containers are lightweight virtual instances that utilises the kernel of the host system instead of virtualising the entire hardware for a full operating system for a virtual machine. Containers use less resources than a full virtual machine, but it means that there are limitations on what can be run, for example, only Linux-based containers can work.\nThere are many ready-made templates available for use already in Proxmox. Just select the one you want and click download.\nLVM-Thin Storage LVM-Thin storage is a block storage format, but allows thin-provisioning of Virtual Instances. This means that instead of allocating storage for a virtual machine based on the volume of the disk, it allocates it only when it\u0026rsquo;s written. This way if I have three VMs with 500GB disks, but each is using only 100GBs, I could put them on a 500GB LVM-Thin storage without issue, once the total usage within each of the VMs don\u0026rsquo;t add up to greater than 500GB.\nThis is something that you should monitor if you plan to use. Here you can see while I have four VMs with about 500GB of drive space allocated among them, only 31GB are actually consumed.\nNext steps In my next post I will walk through the virtual networking setup so you can have your machines talk to each other, or to networks outside of the host.\n","permalink":"https://essgeelabs.com/posts/home-lab-with-proxmox/","summary":"A virtualisation server goes a long way when building your home lab. Consider Proxmox for your project.","title":"Home Lab With Proxmox"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with many different organisations and I\u0026rsquo;ve come across a few common items when it comes to LAN switches that I though I should document in the hope it will help others.\nOversubscription Network Hierarchy Most networkers know the below diagram as the network hierarchy made up of the core, distribution and access layers. But many don\u0026rsquo;t consider the oversubscription ratios when implementing the hierarchy.\nOversubscription is the aggregation ratio of the sum of the downlinks to the sum of the uplinks. The diagram below shows the recommended oversubscription ratios:\nDistribution to Core - 4:1 Access to Distribution - 20:1 A relatively standard ratio helps maintain predictability in network performance and experience. Although I know this is hard when many businesses keep switches forever sometimes and just add to it.\nModules Another oversubscription that is not considered is the internal switch ratios. This is especially notable in modular switches, where the speed that the module is connected to the backplane is less than the sum of the port speeds available.\nFor example the backplane speed may be 40Gbps, but the card module has 8 x 10Gbps ports. That\u0026rsquo;s 160Gbps throughput (8 ports x 10Gbps x 2 input/output) giving an oversubscription of 4:1.\nControllers Oversubscription in fixed configuration switches is generally not too much a problem. But consider the Cisco 3560G switch - it has 32Gbps switching backplane. With the 24-port configuration it has 24 + 2 Gigabit ports, but the 48-port configuration has 48 + 4 Gigabit ports.\nNewer switches have much faster backplanes though.\nAlso consider network controller placement in switches. Switches often look like the picture below. The ports are not segmented for aesthetics, or to make it easy to tell port numbers, but is often an indication of how the switch controllers are placed. Ports are not usually wired to utilise a single network controller, and the ports are split up between two or more controllers.\nI would often see people wire a switch and just start from the beginning starting with one, and you may have all first 12 ports filled, but the rest empty, except for the uplink port. It\u0026rsquo;s better to split the cables so 6 are in the first half and the rest are in the second half.\nRoot bridges and daisy chains Too many places I\u0026rsquo;ve been where they just hook switches up as they need to without any thought about the topology. And I mean even in places with a mature IT department. I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan of daisy chaining switches - I much rather switch stacks - but I do understand them to be necessary in many cases.\nIf you are deciding to daisy chain switches, especially if you are including redundant paths, ensure that you specify the root bridge in the topology. I see many places where they just install the switches and have no clue what is the root bridge.\nConsider the case where switches are connected in a way where the root bridge is at the far left corner. The paths that are forwarding are shown in green and is one possible converged spanning tree.\nNow consider where the main switch off the router is configured as the root bridge.\nThe paths to the main switch is drastically different. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look so bad in this illustration, but consider cases where there are two dozen or more switches in the topology; it can get nasty.\nDiameter issues Another important aspect about choosing the root bridge is the diameter of the bridge network, which is how far away switches are from each other. The maximum diameter between two switches is seven hops away from each other. A switch will discard the bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) if it exceeds the diameter (in actuality the maximum age). If the root bridge is far away, then the BPDU can be discarded and the spanning tree will not converge.\nLuckily, I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen this happen in my lifetime. And I have to say it\u0026rsquo;s luck because I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some really wild topologies. But I have read stories, so it\u0026rsquo;s one of the few reasons I shy away from daisy chains.\nSpanning Tree load sharing Considering the images above, note that some of the redundant paths are in a blocking state. It means those links are essentially unused. All modern switches come with Per VLAN Spanning Tree used by default, which means there is a spanning tree instance for every VLAN specified.\nThis can be done by modifying the spanning tree cost of the interfaces of the switches connected to the root bridge. This way you can send some VLANs on one path, and the others on the next path. This takes some planning, and not to mention management going forward, but can have immense performance benefits considering the oversubscription points above.\n","permalink":"https://essgeelabs.com/posts/network-switching-tips/","summary":"In my experience I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed several things that many people don\u0026rsquo;t know about switches so I thought it wise to document some.

I did that because I had started to look some time ago at static website generators.\nThe conception For most of my online web-publishing life I\u0026rsquo;ve been using WordPress. Before that, I used to create static web pages by writing HTML in a text editor (I can\u0026rsquo;t remember which one) and hosted on the now defunct theglobe.com.\nI really like WordPress. It makes blogging easy and it\u0026rsquo;s very well supported with tons of plugins and themes to choose from to customise the look at feel of your site. It was through WordPress that I really took up blogging and learning about CSS, PHP and MySQL.\nBut WordPress was a pain to keep updating. And when it came to changing the theme, it was a chore. I would build a staging environment on my computer, but there was no way to transfer that exactly as is to the production site. I would copy the theme across, with images and plugins, then add back the widgets as needed. Sometimes a backup and restore would work, but that was not guaranteed.\nSo I started to look for a different way, and that\u0026rsquo;s how I found static website generators.\nStatic Website Generators Static Website Generators does just what its name implies - generates a static website.\nStatic website generators uses templates to generate entire websites composes only of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. This means that sites can run faster, and more securely because there\u0026rsquo;s no application running in the backend to render the pages.\nIt also means that I could easily run an entire CI/CD pipeline for any type of changes to the website, whether it\u0026rsquo;s adding posts, pages, or even changing the theme.\nThere are a quite a few static website generators out there such as:\nJekyll Gatsby Pelican Eleventy Each has their own set of advantages all written in their own language such as Ruby (Jekyll), JS (Eleventy, Gatsby) or Python (Pelican).\nI opted to go with Hugo, which is a generator written in the Go programming language. Why? Hugo is fast, comes with its own set of binaries, very active community, and lots of themes to choose from. The last one is important because my front-end skill sucks.\nTo begin This is not a newbie tutorial. You should be comfortable with the command-line and understand how web server and web hosting works.\nLike my last post, you should have Git installed, which you can download from the Git website.\nYou can use any web editing tool that you would like. I use Visual Studio Code for most of my editing needs.\nAnd you need somewhere to host this. I use BlueHost, but there are other options out there. I want to move this site later to Netlify or a cloud host like my favourite, Digital Ocean.\nInstalling Hugo First thing to do is install Hugo. The easiest way to do this on Windows is to use Chocolatey.\nInstall Chocolatey and then, at the command or PowerShell prompt, install Hugo by running:\nchoco install hugo -confirm If you want a nice GUI to manage your Chocolatey packages, install the Chocolatey GUI by running:\nchoco install chocolateygui Then you can open the Chocolatey GUI from the Programs menu.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it. Hugo is installed. You can check your Hugo version by typing:\nhugo version Building your first Hugo site At the command prompt, navigate to the location that you want to create your new site. This is not the location where you have the web files of your current website if you followed my last tutorial, and must be a new location.\nNow type:\nhugo new site \u0026lt;your new site name\u0026gt; e.g. hugo new site essgeelabs.net\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re going to add a theme to it. A theme gives the site the look and feel. You could create that from scratch by creating the layout and asset files, but why do that to yourself.\nYou can find Hugo themes by going to themes.gohugo.io. This site (at the time of writing) is using PaperMod, but for this example I\u0026rsquo;m going to use Mainroad.\nChange directory to the folder created with your new site\u0026rsquo;s name. Now we\u0026rsquo;ll use Git to download the theme after first initialising Git.\ncd essgeelabs.net\rgit init\rgit submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad The last command initialises the theme as a submodule in the repository into the themes/mainroad directory. The parameter depth=1 is not necessary, but it reduces the size of the repository by only downloading up to the last commit.\nNow add theme = \u0026quot;mainroad\u0026quot; to the config.toml file.\necho \u0026#39;theme = \u0026#34;mainroad\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; .\\config.toml The config.toml file holds configuration information for the site. The file can also be YAML or JSON based. I prefer YAML myself, but for this example we\u0026rsquo;ll continue using TOML as it\u0026rsquo;s the default. You can use a TOML to YAML converter if you wish to switch as well. You will need to delete the config.toml file if you do wish to use config.yaml, as the TOML file is higher in priority.\nNow your site is ready for some content.\nAdd some content At this point you\u0026rsquo;re ready to add some content to your site. At the command-line enter:\nhugo new posts/first-post.md This will create a file first-post.md in the folder posts in the folder content. The .md extension means that it\u0026rsquo;s as Markdown file and uses markdown syntax for formatting. It takes getting a little used to, but once you learn the basic syntax you\u0026rsquo;ll really like using it.\nOpen the file first-post.md in an editor like Visual Studio Code, which I use. You will see:\n---\rtitle: \u0026#34;First Post\u0026#34;\rdate: 2022-04-23T14:36:21-04:00\rdraft: true\r--- This is called the Front Matter, and it holds metadata about the page and the contents. In this case the front matter is written in YAML format.\nThe created page provides:\nThe title. The date it was written. This will appear as the posted date, so change this as necessary. If this page is a draft. Draft pages are not generated. Using the hugo new command creates a page with the defined front matter information. The theme may provide other options and a template can be customised with these, but this is beyond the scope of this tutorial.\nNow add some content after the front matter and below the last ---, which is the YAML delimiter. For example:\nI\u0026#39;m using Hugo to build my new website. Hugo is awesome. Save the file.\nUse the built-in web server to preview your page Hugo has an internal web server that you can use to view the config. At the command-line type:\nhugo server -D The -D means to also show drafts.\nYou should get:\nStart building sites … hugo v0.97.3-078053a43d746a26aa3d48cf1ec7122ae78a9bb4 windows/amd64 BuildDate=2022-04-18T17:22:19Z VendorInfo=gohugoio\r| EN -------------------+-----\rPages | 10\rPaginator pages | 0\rNon-page files | 0\rStatic files | 5\rProcessed images | 0\rAliases | 4\rSitemaps | 1\rCleaned | 0\rBuilt in 69 ms\rWatching for changes in C:\\Users\\sganpat\\Website\\essgeelabs.net\\{archetypes,content,data,layouts,static,themes}\rWatching for config changes in C:\\Users\\sganpat\\Website\\essgeelabs.net\\config.toml\rEnvironment: \u0026#34;development\u0026#34;\rServing pages from memory\rRunning in Fast Render Mode.

At the command-line run:\nhugo All the pages will be output by default into the public folder of the Hugo project folder.\nIf you followed my last tutorial on using Git with cPanel, you will move all the files from the public folder into the folder that you created for the website.\nCreate a .cpanel.yml file with the following contents:\n---\rdeployment:\rtasks:\r- export DEPLOYPATH=/home/essgeelab/public_html/essgeelabs.net/\r- /bin/cp -Rf categories $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp -Rf img $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp -Rf page $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp -Rf posts $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp -Rf tags $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp -Rf css $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp -Rf js $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp 404.html $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp favicon.ico $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp apple-touch-icon.png $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp index.html $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp index.xml $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp sitemap.xml $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp style.css $DEPLOYPATH Now add and commit the files, then push to the webserver.\ngit add *\rgit commit -m \u0026#39;New Hugo site\u0026#39;\rgit push Your site should now be live!\n","permalink":"https://essgeelabs.com/posts/hugo-blog-1/","summary":"This is the first time I\u0026rsquo;m using Hugo so I made a little tutorial to help others.","title":"Building a blog with Hugo"},{"content":"In getting this website up and running I wanted a way to simplify updating the site from the command line to open opportunities for automation.\nFor this I wanted to be able to use Git to be able to mock up a website and then push the changes to the webhost once I was satisfied. So I was pleasantly surprised to find out that cPanel supports the use of Git repositories to do just that.\ncPanel is a web application that many web hosting providers use to allow customers to self-manage the backend of their websites.\nAll my examples here is based on Bluehost, who I use as my webhost. I\u0026rsquo;m also using Windows 10 but the techniques will work with other OSes.\nTo begin This is not a newbie tutorial. You should be comfortable with the command-line and understand how web server and web hosting works.\nYou should have Git installed. You can download from the Git website.\nYou can use any web editing tool that you would like. Remember that this would be a static website as compared to a dynamic website. I use Visual Studio Code for most of my editing needs.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll need SSH key pairs. Generate them if you don\u0026rsquo;t already have one.\nAnd of course you need a web host that use cPanel with Git Version Control and a domain attached. I\u0026rsquo;m using an addon domain, but this will work for the main domain as well.\nAdd your SSH public key to the web host Log into your web host and in cPanel go to Security, and click on SSH Access. (In Bluehost you have to go to Advanced first.)\nClick on \u0026ldquo;Manage SSH Keys\u0026rdquo;\nThen click on \u0026ldquo;Import Key\u0026rdquo;.\nSpecify a name for the key and paste in the public key only. Then click on \u0026ldquo;Import\u0026rdquo;. Note that I can share my public key without fear of being compromised, which is the advantage of public-private key pairs.\nYou should see the new key in the \u0026ldquo;Public Keys\u0026rdquo; list. Click on \u0026ldquo;Manage\u0026rdquo; in the line with the key.\nNow click on \u0026ldquo;Authorize\u0026rdquo;. You should get a message saying that they key has been authorised.\nWhen you go back to the Public Key list you should see the \u0026ldquo;Authorization Status\u0026rdquo; of the key as \u0026ldquo;authorized\u0026rdquo;.\nCreate your Git Repository to cPanel Back to cPanel, go to \u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Git Version Control\u0026rdquo;.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll be creating a new repository. Click \u0026ldquo;Create\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the \u0026ldquo;Create Repository\u0026rdquo; window, disable the \u0026ldquo;Clone a Repository\u0026rdquo; toggle. This is only if you have an existing website hosted in another Git repository such as GitHub. We will be creating an empty repository.\nEnter the repository path. I created a folder for my repositories, and you should do the same. This is not the folder that is used to store your web pages (usually the ~/public_html or ~/www folders). You\u0026rsquo;ll see how to get the files in the correct location after.\nEnter a name for the repository.\nThen click on \u0026ldquo;Create\u0026rdquo;.\nYou should see a message that it was created successfully along with some instructions to add the repository to an existing project, or to clone the repository and build a new project. Copy and save these instructions.\nYour repository should now be listed into your list of repositories.\nEdit the SSH config Since the cPanel Git uses SSH to access the repository, you need to edit the SSH config file to point to your SSH private key file.\nGo to your home folder.\nIn Windows it\u0026rsquo;ll be something like:\nC:\\Users\\\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\\\nIn Linux it\u0026rsquo;ll be:\n\\home\\\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\\ or just ~\\\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see a .ssh folder, if not, create it. Edit or create a text file named \u0026ldquo;config\u0026rdquo; with no extension (no .txt or anything).\nAdd the following to the file:\nHost \u0026lt;domain name\u0026gt;\rHostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\rPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa\rUser \u0026lt;username to access web host\u0026gt;\rIdentityFile \u0026#34;\u0026lt;full path to private key e.g. c:\\keys\\private.key\u0026#34;\rPort 22 Save and close.\nClone the Git repository to your local computer Once you have Git installed, you can clone the repository to your local computer. In this example we\u0026rsquo;re cloning and not using an existing copy of a web site.\nYou can copy the Clone URL from the cPanel Git Version Control list.\nOpen a command or PowerShell prompt and navigate to the place where you would like to clone the repository.\nPS C:\\Users\\sganpat\\Website\u0026gt; git clone ssh://\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@essgeelabs.net/home/essgeelab/repositories/essgeelab.net\rCloning into \u0026#39;essgeelab.net\u0026#39;...\rwarning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository. cd essgeeglab.net Create a Readme file to do an initial commit and push.\necho \u0026#34;# Readme\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; README.md\rgit add README.md\rgit commit -m \u0026#34;initial commit\u0026#34;\rgit push -u origin master You should get output like:\nEnumerating objects: 3, done.\rCounting objects: 100% (3/3), done.\rWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 216 bytes | 108.00 KiB/s, done.\rTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\rremote: Recieved update on checked-out branch, queueing deployment.\rremote: ---\rremote: apiversion: 3\rremote: func: create\rremote: module: VersionControlDeployment\rremote: result:\rremote: data: ~\rremote: errors: ~\rremote: messages: ~\rremote: metadata: {}\rremote:\rremote: status: 1\rremote: warnings: ~\rTo ssh://essgeelabs.net/home/essgeelab/repositories/essgeelab.net\r\\* [new branch] master -\u0026gt; master Great.

But when you browse to the URL it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. That\u0026rsquo;s because it needs to be deployed. To do this, you need to create a text file called .cpanel.yml and add your deploy tasks in there. These are the bash commands you would run to deploy the site from the repository folder.\nFor instance, in my case it would be to copy the index.html and style.css files and the images folder to the root directory of the web server. So my .cpanel.yml file will look like:\n---\rdeployment:\rtasks:\r- export DEPLOYPATH=/home/essgeelab/public_html/essgeelabs.net/\r- /bin/cp index.html $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp style.css $DEPLOYPATH\r- /bin/cp -R images $DEPLOYPATH now commit that file and push to the remote respository.\ngit add .cpanel.yml\rgit commit -m \u0026#34;cpanel deploy file\u0026#34;\rgit push origin master Now the website should be operational.\n","permalink":"https://essgeelabs.com/posts/cpanel-git-1/","summary":"Configuing cPanel Git Versioning for Web Site deployment","title":"Using Git with cPanel to update your website"},{"content":"Welcome I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to put up a website like this for a really long time, but never got around to doing it. While I have by personal and business website, I\u0026rsquo;ve never put up a technical one.\nThe truth is that even with over two decades of experience, I still feel that what I have to offer is not enough. That whatever I say is going to sound stupid or is not valuable.

But I hope it helps someone.\nWhy put up this site? The main aim of the site is to share my knowledge and help others who are trying to do the same thing I am doing.\nBut why do this when there are tons of sites out there doing the same?\nBecause if you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you\u0026rsquo;ve found that even going through those sites don\u0026rsquo;t help all the time and you end up figuring out things on your own or by putting the pieces together.
