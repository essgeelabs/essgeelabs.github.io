[{"content":"Welcome I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to put up a website like this for a really long time, but never got around to doing it. While I have by personal and business website, I\u0026rsquo;ve never put up a technical one.\nThe truth is that even with over two decades of experience, I still feel that what I have to offer is not enough. That whatever I say is going to sound stupid or is not valuable. Which is weird because I know many people value my input in things.\nImposter syndrome is a heck of a thing.\nWhat to expect At the home page says, I\u0026rsquo;m using this site to document some of the things that I\u0026rsquo;m learning and experimenting with. I\u0026rsquo;ll also add information that I\u0026rsquo;ve found useful in my day-to-day activities as a network and infrastructure engineer/manager.\nTopics in my head:\n - DevOps, DevSecOps and CyberSecurity\n - Network and Infrastructure Architectures\n - Machine Learning and Intelligence Augmentation\n - Electronics and The Internet of Things\n - Web Development and Programming in Python\nI expect this to be very broad and varied so the SEO might be shit. But I hope it helps someone.\nWhy put up this site? The main aim of the site is to share my knowledge and help others who are trying to do the same thing I am doing.\nBut why do this when there are tons of sites out there doing the same?\nBecause if you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you\u0026rsquo;ve found that even going through those sites don\u0026rsquo;t help all the time and you end up figuring out things on your own or by putting the pieces together. Here I hope you find all the pieces in one place.\nBut more so, I want to hold myself accountable in actually doing the things I put in the list.\nI hope you enjoy the journey with me.
