  "articleBody": "Now that our Check Point appliance is up, let’s get to work on setting it up for simple access for internal devices.\nDownload and install SmartConsole First thing, you have to download and install the Check Point SmartConsole, which is the thick client that allows you to manage your Check Point products. Remember that you need a Microsoft Windows operating system to use the SmartConsole.\nFrom the web interface go to “Maintenance” –\u003e “Download SmartConsole”. Then click on the “Download Button”.\nOnce you have downloaded and successfully installed, launch the SmartConsole.\nEnter your username (“admin” if you used the default user) and the password you specified. Enter the Check Point management IP address then click “Login”.\nThe first time you’re logging in you will get a “Fingerprint” prompt to confirm that you’re connecting to the correct server, and not some rouge one somewhere.\nYou can confirm the fingerprint by going to the web interface of the management server and doing a search for “fingerprint”, or go to “System Management” –\u003e “Certificate Authority”.\nCompare the fingerprint on the page, to the fingerprint in the SmartConsole. Then click proceed if it matches. Otherwise, you have some investigating to do.\nGetting familiar with SmartConsole Now that SmartConsole is installed and connected to the firewall, let’s check out some basic features that you’ll use regularly.\nIn the first pane you have an overview of all the gateways and servers in your Check Point estate. In this case I have only one, but if you have several enforcement points, logging servers and a management server, you will find them all here.\nAt the right you’ll see all the objects that are available to view and configure. You’ll see some later down, but I’ll go more into these in a later post.\nIn the “Security Policies” section you configure the security features such as rules, network address translation (NAT) and inspection policies.\nSelecting “Policy” under “Access Control” shows you the rule base. For a clean install, only one rule is present, which is the “Cleanup Rule”. This is an explicit “deny all” rule. While many firewalls allow all traffic - or web only traffic - by default, Check Point will have none of that. You need to explicitly allow your traffic.\nSelect “NAT” to view the network address translation rules. There are only a couple automatic rules right now. We’ll go through NAT and configuring NAT rules at another time.\nGo to the “Logs and Monitor” section to access the log viewer. Check Point has, in my opinion, the best log viewer of any firewall that I’ve used. The log viewer has remained largely unchanged over the past twenty years and has always remained highly usable. This is an area we’ll explore another time as well.\nThe “Manage \u0026 Settings” section allows you to configure the administrative management settings.\nGo to “Permissions and Administrators” –\u003e “Administrators”. Here you can add/delete/modify administrators for the Check Point management console. This is for Check Point management and not for the web interface, which is done via the Gaia web management.\nGo to “Trusted Clients” and you can limit the clients that can connect to the Check Point management by adding them here and removing “AnyHost”.\nGo to “Sessions” –\u003e “View Sessions” and you can see the sessions that are connected to the management console at the moment. It’s only my connection here, but Check Point has added the capability for multiple persons to edit the rulebase at a time; this was previously not possible and was a pleasant surprise for me when I first upgraded to R80.\nYou can see the revisions made on the rulebase by going to “Revisions”. This is useful as your rulebase becomes more complicated and you have multiple administrators.\nEnough of an overview, let’s get to configuring some rules.\nAdding the networks to the gateway object Before we start with the rules, we need to ensure that the gateway has access to all of the network interfaces available to it.\nRemember that the Check Point security gateway is an application on top of the operating system, which is Gaia (a hardened version of Linux). This is different to other firewalls such as Cisco ASA or Fortinet Fortigates where the OS and the firewall are one. So while the interfaces may have been configured in Gaia, we need to add them to the Check Point gateway.\nOpen the Check Point gateway object by double-clicking on it, or by selecting and clicking on the pencil icon above the list.\nThe “General Properties” shows an overview of the gateway and shows the features enabled for it. You can check other features to enable, but we won’t get into that right now.\nGo to “Network Management”. Here you will see a list of the interfaces currently available. You will notice that the DMZ interface that we configured is not showing in the list. Also the “Topology” is shown as “Undefined”. Topology is how Check Point determines which networks are behind which interfaces so that it can do reverse-path and anti-spoofing checks.\nTo add the other interfaces click on “Get Interfaces” –\u003e “Get interfaces with Topology”. This will get all the interfaces and any routing information as well.\nYou’ll get a little warning about getting the interfaces with topology. This is safe to do given that this is a new firewall; however, if you have an existing firewall and you’ve configured custom topologies and anti-spoofing settings, then it is best to not get the interfaces with topology and configure the topology manually.\nIn this case, we shout “YOLO” and click “Yes”.\nYou get the results of the retrieval. Notice that the DMZ interface was retrieved as eth2, while the others are unchanged.\nClick “Accept”.\nNow our networks have been defined, along with the topology. You’ll notice that eth0 was defined as “External” in the topology; this is because the default gateway was specified for that network.\nImplied rules Now that the networks have been defined let’s look at creating access control policies, or rules.\nBefore we do that, there are some implied rules that exist. These are rules that are not explicitly defined in the rulebase, but exist in the firewall configuration. These are to allow access mainly for management and control protocols.\nYou can view these implied rules by clicking on the three-dots, or ellipses, or kebab, above the rules and going to “Actions” –\u003e “Implied Rules…”.\nHere you can view the implied rules configured.\nIf you wish to change these implied rules, you go to the “Global Properties” in the main menu bar dropdown.\nHere you can select which ones you wish to allow or deny, and where they can exist in the rulebase if available. I’ve only ever done this once for a customer, but for every other implementation I’ve kept the defaults. If you do decide to uncheck certain items, you need to explicitly configure the rules in the rulebase or you can lock yourself out.\nNotice that implied rules are not logged by default.\nCreate your first rules Let’s create a rule. We’ll create a rule to allow internal users to access all the services over the “Internet”.\nRight-click on a rule in the rulebase and select either “Above” or “Below” for “New Rule”. Rules are evaluated from top-to-bottom order, so you need to place the rule above the “Cleanup rule”.\nAstute readers would notice another rule defined that was not there before called the “Stealth Rule”. I put that rule in but didn’t capture it; sorry if that confused you. The stealth rule “hides” the firewall from anyone trying to connect directly to it, and is a best practice.\nSpecify the source by clicking on the plus sign, or add button, in the cell. A dialog showing all of the available network objects is displayed. Because the Internal network is not yet created, click on the star icon at the top, right-hand corner of the dialog box to add it.\nSpecify the name of the object, the IP address and network mask.\nOptionally, you can change the colour of the object and add a tag, which is assist in administration, but doesn’t change functionality.\nBy default, Check Point does not enable NAT. Click on “NAT” and check the box “Add automatic address translation rules”.\nEnsure that the “Translation method” is selected as “Hide”, and “Hide behind the gateway” is selected. This means that all traffic coming from that network is “hidden” behind the destination interface of the firewall, in this case eth0’s IP address. You can choose to hide behind another IP address in cases where you have others to use.\nThe other option of “Static” is for 1-to-1 NAT, and is not generally utilised for network objects.\nClick “OK” to save.\nWe’ll set this rule to “any” destination. Click on the down arrow and select “Switch to ‘Any’”.\nRepeat this for “Services \u0026 Applications” for now. This is the destination service.\nRules are created as “Drop” by default. Click the down arrow and select “Accept” to allow the traffic.\nRules by default are not logged. Click on the down arrow and select “Log” to log the traffic.\nThe other option is “Alert” and allows for alerts to be sent, e.g. via email, when a rule is hit. This is useful for cases such as honeypots, so you can be alerted to possible malicious activities taking place.\nLet’s create a rule to allow ICMP traffic (pings, traceroute, etc.) from both the Internal network and the DMZ to anywhere, including the firewall. This is just like the previous rule, but because we wish to be able to ping the firewall, we need to create it above the stealth rule.\nYou will also need to create a network object for the DMZ network, which you should be able to using the Internal_Net example.\nBut because we only want to allow ICMP, we need to specify the service. Click the plus, or add, button in the cell under “Services \u0026 Applications”. Search for “icmp”, then select “icmp-request” by clicking on the plus, or add, sign. Close the dialog box.\nLet’s change the rule for user internet access to allow just HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Go to the rule, and click on the plus, or add, sign in the cell under “Services \u0026 Applications” and search for “http”. Then select “http” and “https” by clicking on the plus, or add, sign. Close the dialog.\nNow we have our initial rulebase to be installed.\nIf you look at the top, you’ll see some menu items. That number - 35 in this case - is the number of changes to be made. If you go through the previous screenshots, you’ll see the number changing with each change.\nAt this point we can discard all of the changes, or we can publish them. Publishing saves the changes, but doesn’t push, or install, the policy on the firewall. This allows changes to be made during the day, and then pushed out during a maintenance window if anything.\nClick on “Publish” to publish your changes. You can change the name and add a description, which is highly recommended as it gives other administrators, and even you, an idea of what change was made and why. In my practice, I also add the ticket number assigned for the change to reference.\nOnce you’ve published the changes, you can go ahead and click on “Install Policy”, which will push the policy to the firewalls.\nNote, you didn’t have to publish first, and then install the policy. If you click on “Install Policy” without publishing, you will be asked to publish the changes before the installation will continue.\nThe “Install Policy” dialog is pretty standard in our case as there is only one firewall, but you can have multiple gateways to push to, including clusters.\nClick “Install”.\nA progress indication is show at the bottom, left-hand corner. You can click on the bar to see more info.\nInstall successful. If you see any red X’s, you need to investigate. But for our simple setup here, this shouldn’t happen.\nAnd there you go, you’ve created your first rule. You can go ahead and test access. If you’re not getting through then you can check the logs for some help. My next Check Point post will go into more on the log viewer and on configuring NAT, once I get to it before this eval expires on me.\n",

This is an explicit &ldquo;deny all&rdquo; rule. While many firewalls allow all traffic - or web only traffic - by default, Check Point will have none of that. You need to explicitly allow your traffic.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/06.png" alt="Security Policy"  />
</p>
<p>Select &ldquo;NAT&rdquo; to view the network address translation rules. There are only a couple automatic rules right now. We&rsquo;ll go through NAT and configuring NAT rules at another time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/07.png" alt="NAT Rules"  />
</p>
<p>Go to the &ldquo;Logs and Monitor&rdquo; section to access the log viewer. Check Point has, in my opinion, the best log viewer of any firewall that I&rsquo;ve used. The log viewer has remained largely unchanged over the past twenty years and has always remained highly usable. This is an area we&rsquo;ll explore another time as well.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/08.png" alt="Log viewer"  />
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Manage &amp; Settings&rdquo; section allows you to configure the administrative management settings.</p>
<p>Go to &ldquo;Permissions and Administrators&rdquo; &ndash;&gt; &ldquo;Administrators&rdquo;. Here you can add/delete/modify administrators for the Check Point management console. This is for Check Point management and not for the web interface, which is done via the Gaia web management.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/09.png" alt="Management settings - administrators"  />
</p>
<p>Go to &ldquo;Trusted Clients&rdquo; and you can limit the clients that can connect to the Check Point management by adding them here and removing &ldquo;AnyHost&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/10.png" alt="Trusted Clients"  />
</p>
<p>Go to &ldquo;Sessions&rdquo; &ndash;&gt; &ldquo;View Sessions&rdquo; and you can see the sessions that are connected to the management console at the moment. It&rsquo;s only my connection here, but Check Point has added the capability for multiple persons to edit the rulebase at a time; this was previously not possible and was a pleasant surprise for me when I first upgraded to R80.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/11.png" alt="Sessions"  />
</p>
<p>You can see the revisions made on the rulebase by going to &ldquo;Revisions&rdquo;. This is useful as your rulebase becomes more complicated and you have multiple administrators.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/12.png" alt="Revisions"  />
</p>
<p>Enough of an overview, let&rsquo;s get to configuring some rules.</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-networks-to-the-gateway-object">Adding the networks to the gateway object<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#adding-the-networks-to-the-gateway-object">#</a></h2>
<p>Before we start with the rules, we need to ensure that the gateway has access to all of the network interfaces available to it.</p>
<p>Remember that the Check Point security gateway is an application on top of the operating system, which is Gaia (a hardened version of Linux). This is different to other firewalls such as Cisco ASA or Fortinet Fortigates where the OS and the firewall are one. So while the interfaces may have been configured in Gaia, we need to add them to the Check Point gateway.</p>
<p>Open the Check Point gateway object by double-clicking on it, or by selecting and clicking on the pencil icon above the list.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/13.png" alt="Open the gateway object"  />
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;General Properties&rdquo; shows an overview of the gateway and shows the features enabled for it. You can check other features to enable, but we won&rsquo;t get into that right now.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/14.png" alt="gateway object properties"  />
</p>
<p>Go to &ldquo;Network Management&rdquo;. Here you will see a list of the interfaces currently available. You will notice that the <a href="https://essgeelabs.com/posts/build-a-check-point-firewall-lab/#configure-additional-networks">DMZ interface that we configured</a> is not showing in the list. Also the &ldquo;Topology&rdquo; is shown as &ldquo;Undefined&rdquo;. Topology is how Check Point determines which networks are behind which interfaces so that it can do reverse-path and anti-spoofing checks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/15.png" alt="Network management of the gateway"  />
</p>
<p>To add the other interfaces click on &ldquo;Get Interfaces&rdquo; &ndash;&gt; &ldquo;Get interfaces with Topology&rdquo;. This will get all the interfaces and any routing information as well.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/16.png" alt="Get interfaces"  />
</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get a little warning about getting the interfaces with topology. This is safe to do given that this is a new firewall; however, if you have an existing firewall and you&rsquo;ve configured custom topologies and anti-spoofing settings, then it is best to not get the interfaces with topology and configure the topology manually.</p>
<p>In this case, we shout &ldquo;YOLO&rdquo; and click &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/17.png" alt="17"  />
</p>
<p>You get the results of the retrieval. Notice that the DMZ interface was retrieved as eth2, while the others are unchanged.</p>
<p>Click &ldquo;Accept&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/18.png" alt="Interfaces retrieved"  />
</p>
<p>Now our networks have been defined, along with the topology. You&rsquo;ll notice that eth0 was defined as &ldquo;External&rdquo; in the topology; this is because the default gateway was specified for that network.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/19.png" alt="new networks"  />
</p>
<h2 id="implied-rules">Implied rules<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implied-rules">#</a></h2>
<p>Now that the networks have been defined let&rsquo;s look at creating access control policies, or rules.</p>
<p>Before we do that, there are some implied rules that exist. These are rules that are not explicitly defined in the rulebase, but exist in the firewall configuration. These are to allow access mainly for management and control protocols.</p>
<p>You can view these implied rules by clicking on the three-dots, or ellipses, or kebab, above the rules and going to &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; &ndash;&gt; &ldquo;Implied Rules&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/20.png" alt="getting to view implied rules"  />
</p>
<p>Here you can view the implied rules configured.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/21.png" alt="Implied rules"  />
</p>
<p>If you wish to change these implied rules, you go to the &ldquo;Global Properties&rdquo; in the main menu bar dropdown.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/22.png" alt="Get to the implied rules configuration"  />
</p>
<p>Here you can select which ones you wish to allow or deny, and where they can exist in the rulebase if available. I&rsquo;ve only ever done this once for a customer, but for every other implementation I&rsquo;ve kept the defaults. If you do decide to uncheck certain items, you need to explicitly configure the rules in the rulebase or you can lock yourself out.</p>
<p>Notice that implied rules are not logged by default.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/23.png" alt="Implied rules configuration"  />
</p>
<h2 id="create-your-first-rules">Create your first rules<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#create-your-first-rules">#</a></h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create a rule. We&rsquo;ll create a rule to allow internal users to access all the services over the &ldquo;Internet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Right-click on a rule in the rulebase and select either &ldquo;Above&rdquo; or &ldquo;Below&rdquo; for &ldquo;New Rule&rdquo;. Rules are evaluated from top-to-bottom order, so you need to place the rule above the &ldquo;Cleanup rule&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/24.png" alt="Create a rule"  />
</p>
<p>Astute readers would notice another rule defined that was not there before called the &ldquo;Stealth Rule&rdquo;. I put that rule in but didn&rsquo;t capture it; sorry if that confused you. The stealth rule &ldquo;hides&rdquo; the firewall from anyone trying to connect directly to it, and is a best practice.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/25.png" alt="stealth rule"  />
</p>
<p>Specify the source by clicking on the plus sign, or add button, in the cell. A dialog showing all of the available network objects is displayed. Because the Internal network is not yet created, click on the star icon at the top, right-hand corner of the dialog box to add it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/26.png" alt="Add the source network"  />
</p>
<p>Specify the name of the object, the IP address and network mask.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can change the colour of the object and add a tag, which is assist in administration, but doesn&rsquo;t change functionality.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/27.png" alt="Create the network object"  />
</p>
<p>By default, Check Point does not enable NAT. Click on &ldquo;NAT&rdquo; and check the box &ldquo;Add automatic address translation rules&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ensure that the &ldquo;Translation method&rdquo; is selected as &ldquo;Hide&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Hide behind the gateway&rdquo; is selected. This means that all traffic coming from that network is &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; behind the destination interface of the firewall, in this case eth0&rsquo;s IP address. You can choose to hide behind another IP address in cases where you have others to use.</p>
<p>The other option of &ldquo;Static&rdquo; is for 1-to-1 NAT, and is not generally utilised for network objects.</p>
<p>Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to save.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/28.png" alt="Specify the NAT setting"  />
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll set this rule to &ldquo;any&rdquo; destination. Click on the down arrow and select &ldquo;Switch to &lsquo;Any&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Repeat this for &ldquo;Services &amp; Applications&rdquo; for now. This is the destination service.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/29.png" alt="Allow to any destination"  />
</p>
<p>Rules are created as &ldquo;Drop&rdquo; by default. Click the down arrow and select &ldquo;Accept&rdquo; to allow the traffic.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/30.png" alt="Allow this access"  />
</p>
<p>Rules by default are not logged. Click on the down arrow and select &ldquo;Log&rdquo; to log the traffic.</p>
<p>The other option is &ldquo;Alert&rdquo; and allows for alerts to be sent, e.g. via email, when a rule is hit. This is useful for cases such as honeypots, so you can be alerted to possible malicious activities taking place.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/31.png" alt="Log the access"  />
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create a rule to allow ICMP traffic (pings, traceroute, etc.) from both the Internal network and the DMZ to anywhere, including the firewall. This is just like the previous rule, but because we wish to be able to ping the firewall, we need to create it above the stealth rule.</p>
<p>You will also need to create a network object for the DMZ network, which you should be able to using the Internal_Net example.</p>
<p>But because we only want to allow ICMP, we need to specify the service. Click the plus, or add, button in the cell under &ldquo;Services &amp; Applications&rdquo;. Search for &ldquo;icmp&rdquo;, then select &ldquo;icmp-request&rdquo; by clicking on the plus, or add, sign. Close the dialog box.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/32.png" alt="Specify ICMP group"  />
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change the rule for user internet access to allow just HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Go to the rule, and click on the plus, or add, sign in the cell under &ldquo;Services &amp; Applications&rdquo; and search for &ldquo;http&rdquo;. Then select &ldquo;http&rdquo; and &ldquo;https&rdquo; by clicking on the plus, or add, sign. Close the dialog.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/33.png" alt="Change the internet access rule"  />
</p>
<p>Now we have our initial rulebase to be installed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/34.png" alt="Initial rule base"  />
</p>
<p>If you look at the top, you&rsquo;ll see some menu items. That number - 35 in this case - is the number of changes to be made. If you go through the previous screenshots, you&rsquo;ll see the number changing with each change.</p>
<p>At this point we can discard all of the changes, or we can publish them. Publishing saves the changes, but doesn&rsquo;t push, or install, the policy on the firewall. This allows changes to be made during the day, and then pushed out during a maintenance window if anything.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/35.png" alt="publish"  />
</p>
<p>Click on &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; to publish your changes. You can change the name and add a description, which is highly recommended as it gives other administrators, and even you, an idea of what change was made and why. In my practice, I also add the ticket number assigned for the change to reference.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/36.png" alt="36"  />
</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve published the changes, you can go ahead and click on &ldquo;Install Policy&rdquo;, which will push the policy to the firewalls.</p>
<p>Note, you didn&rsquo;t have to publish first, and then install the policy. If you click on &ldquo;Install Policy&rdquo; without publishing, you will be asked to publish the changes before the installation will continue.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Install Policy&rdquo; dialog is pretty standard in our case as there is only one firewall, but you can have multiple gateways to push to, including clusters.</p>
<p>Click &ldquo;Install&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/37.png" alt="Install the policy"  />
</p>
<p>A progress indication is show at the bottom, left-hand corner. You can click on the bar to see more info.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/38.png" alt="Installation Progress"  />
</p>
<p>Install successful. If you see any red X&rsquo;s, you need to investigate. But for our simple setup here, this shouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/39.png" alt="Installation completed"  />
</p>
<p>And there you go, you&rsquo;ve created your first rule. You can go ahead and test access. If you&rsquo;re not getting through then you can check the logs for some help. My next Check Point post will go into more on the log viewer and on configuring NAT, once I get to it before this eval expires on me.</p>
